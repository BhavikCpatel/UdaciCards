This is my version of UdaciCards project for Udacity's React Nanodegree course. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate understanding on React Native and to complete 3rd and last assignment project for React Nanodegree course

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## :zap: Quickstart

To get started developing right away:

1. Clone this repo using "clone" or download ZIP directly from Github and extract
2. `cd` into project root folder (`cd udacicards`)
3. Install all project dependencies using command `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Runs your app in development mode using command `npm start` or `yarn start`
5. follow on-screen instructions to run app on your mobile device or emulator (assuming you have already setup emulator)

If everything goes well, you should be able to see app on your mobile. All the best!

## About Create React App

This project was created using Udacity's React Nanodegree MyReads project template [reactnd-project-myreads-starte] (https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter), which was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information about create-react-app [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Available Scripts

If Yarn was installed when the project was initialized, then dependencies will have been installed via Yarn, and you should probably use it to run these commands as well. Unlike dependency installation, command running syntax is identical for Yarn and NPM at the time of this writing.

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start --reset-cache
# or
yarn start --reset-cache
```

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup). We also recommend installing Genymotion as your Android emulator. Once you've finished setting up the native build environment, there are two options for making the right copy of `adb` available to Create React Native App:

##### Using Android Studio's `adb`

1. Make sure that you can run adb from your terminal.
2. Open Genymotion and navigate to `Settings -> ADB`. Select “Use custom Android SDK tools” and update with your [Android SDK directory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25176594/android-sdk-location).

##### Using Genymotion's `adb`

1. Find Genymotion’s copy of adb. On macOS for example, this is normally `/Applications/Genymotion.app/Contents/MacOS/tools/`.
2. Add the Genymotion tools directory to your path (instructions for [Mac](http://osxdaily.com/2014/08/14/add-new-path-to-path-command-line/), [Linux](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001647.htm), and [Windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/)).
3. Make sure that you can run adb from your terminal.

## Supported platforms

  This app is supported on both iOS and Android platform.
  This app has been tested on iPhone 7, Pixel2 running on Android 6, Pixel XL (emulator) running on Android 7.1, and Samsung Galaxy S4 running on Android 4.4.
